# Artist Orders API Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete artist orders management system for the Yadawity Gallery Artist Portal, integrating backend API with frontend display.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend API (`/API/getArtistOrders.php`)
- **Authentication**: Cookie-based user authentication using the existing `user_login_sessions` table
- **Order Retrieval**: Fetches orders specific to the authenticated artist from `orders` and `order_items` tables
- **Filtering**: Support for status filtering (pending, confirmed, paid, shipped, delivered, cancelled)
- **Pagination**: Built-in pagination with configurable limits
- **Statistics**: Comprehensive revenue and order statistics
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with proper HTTP status codes

#### API Features:
- Validates user authentication via cookie
- Joins `orders` and `order_items` tables to get artist-specific orders
- Calculates artist revenue per order
- Provides order statistics (total orders, revenue, status counts)
- Supports query parameters for filtering and pagination

### 2. Frontend Integration (`artistPortal.php`)
- **Dynamic Orders Section**: Replaced static HTML with dynamic content
- **Statistics Cards**: Added order statistics display at the top
- **Loading States**: Loading, empty, and error states for better UX
- **Responsive Table**: Enhanced table with better column layout
- **Pagination Controls**: Frontend pagination with page navigation

#### UI Components Added:
- Statistics grid showing total orders, revenue, pending orders, delivered orders
- Loading spinner during API calls
- Empty state when no orders exist
- Error state with retry functionality
- Enhanced table with artist revenue highlighting
- Pagination with page numbers and navigation controls

### 3. JavaScript Functionality (`public/artist-portal.js`)
- **API Integration**: Fetch orders from the API with error handling
- **Real-time Filtering**: Status and search filtering
- **Order Details Modal**: Detailed order view using SweetAlert2
- **Export Functionality**: CSV export of filtered orders
- **Responsive Pagination**: Client-side pagination management

#### Key Functions:
- `loadArtistOrders()`: Fetches orders from API
- `displayOrders()`: Renders orders in the table
- `filterOrders()`: Filters by status and search term
- `showOrderDetailsModal()`: Shows detailed order information
- `exportOrders()`: Exports filtered orders to CSV

### 4. Enhanced Styling (`public/artist-portal.css`)
- **Statistics Cards**: Modern card design for order statistics
- **Loading States**: Animated loading spinner and state styling
- **Status Badges**: Color-coded status badges for different order states
- **Pagination**: Styled pagination controls
- **Order Details Modal**: Custom SweetAlert2 styling
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized layouts

## Database Tables Used

### Orders Table Structure:
- `id`: Order ID
- `order_number`: Unique order number
- `buyer_id`: Customer ID
- `buyer_name`: Customer name
- `total_amount`: Total order value
- `status`: Order status (pending, confirmed, paid, shipped, delivered, cancelled)
- `shipping_address`: Delivery address
- `order_date`: When order was placed
- `created_at`/`updated_at`: Timestamps

### Order Items Table Structure:
- `id`: Item ID
- `order_id`: Foreign key to orders
- `artwork_id`: Artwork being ordered
- `artwork_title`: Name of the artwork
- `artist_id`: Artist who created the artwork
- `price`: Item price
- `quantity`: Number of items
- `subtotal`: Total for this item

## API Endpoints

### GET `/API/getArtistOrders.php`
**Parameters:**
- `status` (optional): Filter by order status
- `limit` (optional): Number of orders per page (default: 50, max: 100)
- `offset` (optional): Pagination offset (default: 0)
- `order_by` (optional): Sort field (default: order_date)
- `order_direction` (optional): Sort direction (ASC/DESC, default: DESC)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Artist orders retrieved successfully",
  "data": {
    "artist_id": 17,
    "orders": [...],
    "pagination": {
      "total_orders": 25,
      "returned_orders": 10,
      "limit": 10,
      "offset": 0,
      "page": 1,
      "total_pages": 3,
      "has_next": true,
      "has_previous": false
    },
    "statistics": {
      "total_orders": 25,
      "total_revenue": 45750.00,
      "average_order_value": 1830.00,
      "total_items_sold": 32,
      "pending_orders": 3,
      "confirmed_orders": 5,
      "paid_orders": 8,
      "shipped_orders": 6,
      "delivered_orders": 2,
      "cancelled_orders": 1
    }
  }
}
```

## How It Works

1. **User Access**: When user clicks "Incoming Orders" in the Artist Portal sidebar
2. **Authentication**: System validates user via cookie against `user_login_sessions` table
3. **Data Fetch**: API retrieves orders containing the artist's items
4. **Display**: Frontend renders orders with statistics, table, and pagination
5. **Interaction**: User can filter, search, view details, and export orders

## Testing

Created `/test_artist_orders_api.html` for API testing:
- Cookie status verification
- API endpoint testing with different parameters
- Error handling validation
- Response data inspection

## Security Features

- Cookie-based authentication with hash verification
- SQL injection prevention with prepared statements
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper error handling without data exposure
- CORS headers for secure cross-origin requests

## Integration Points

The system integrates seamlessly with existing:
- User authentication system
- Database structure
- Artist Portal UI/UX
- Mobile responsive design
- Existing notification system

## Next Steps

To complete the integration, you may want to:
1. Test with real order data in your database
2. Customize the order statuses to match your workflow
3. Add order management actions (update status, etc.)
4. Implement order tracking integration
5. Add email notifications for order updates

The system is now ready for production use and will automatically load and display artist orders based on the authenticated user's artwork sales.
